		<h2>Japan - Osaka</h2>
		<p>The land of the rising sun is a great place to visit in any season. I went during late Spring of 2023, which was after cherry blossom season and before the rainy season. I stayed in Osaka and took day trips to other tourist destinations near by, such as the Todaiji Temple in Nara, Himeji Castle in Hyogo. Japan was a destination that has definetly took me out of my comfort zone and gave me an exciting culture shock. Before visiting Japan I recommend doing some research about some of the mannerism of Japanese culture and even some other things that could be tricky such as public transportation. Being prepared about these things for trip to a country that is very different from your own helps make it less stressful and easier to handle the culture shock.</p>
