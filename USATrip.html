		<h2>USA - North Carolina</h2>
		<p>In the summer of 2017, I traveled to a campsite near the North Carolina and Tennessee border to watch the Solar Eclipse with some friends and family. We stayed at a campsite for a day and a half, bringing along with the basic needs for camping. Camping in North Carolina during the summer is no joke due to the blistering heat and humidity combo, however, it is slightly more durable in the mountians. Camping was a great was to disconnect from the devices or the busy daily routine, spending times outdoors in nature and spending time with friends and family. The next big Solar Eclipse to cross the US will be April 8th 2024!</p>
