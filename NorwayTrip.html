		<h2>Norway - Oslo</h2>
		<p>Norway has always been my favorite place to travel, and one of my favorite activities there is hiking and fishing. During my last trip to Norway, I spent most of my time in Oslo, so I decided to tour the city, visiting museums and castles. I highly recommend traveling to Oslo if you're visiting Norway for the first time. It offers an array of attractions for various interests; history lovers can view preserved Viking Ships in the Viking Museum, art enthusiasts can see the famous painting "The Scream" at the Munch Museum, and nature lovers can enjoy boat tours on the Oslo fjord and explore the nearby islands.</p>
